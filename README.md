##Hello world
$ node program.js

$ learnyounode verify program.js
$ learnyounode run program.js

##Baby steps
Write a program that accepts one or more numbers as command-line arguments and prints the sum of those numbers to the console (stdout).

##MY FIRST I/O!
* Write a program that uses a single synchronous filesystem operation to read a file and print the number of newlines it contains to the console (stdout), similar to running cat file | wc -l.
* The full path to the file to read will be provided as the first command-line argument. You do not need to make your own test file.
